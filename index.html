   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <hr>
   <p>Have you ever wondered what technology will be like within the next century? What will be so unique about it, and how will it make human life more convenient? How will the human race behave and adapt with this constant change and implantation of technology? This article will explain my reasons and showcase my ideas and theories into the near future with technology and humanity.</p>

   <h2>The History of Computers</h2>
   <hr>
   <p>First before we look into the future, let us look into the past. Thought out the last one hundred years computers have had a long and complex history. Computers were first starting to be really studied and designed around the Second World War (Computer History Museum). Many complex prototypes were created by both the Axis and the Allie forces (Computer History Museum). In 1948 the first ever Program was run on a computer which was groundbreaking (Computer History Museum). This first program was a calculator, which was ran on a computer about the size of a classroom (Computer History Museum). </p>
   <p>Computer were then made to be faster, smaller, and more efficient thought out the 50s and 60s (Computer History Museum). Keyboard inputs were made to be more direct and user-friendly and was also made to replace punched cards and paper tape (Computer History Museum). With the help of computers, we were able to put a man on the moon with the Apollo Guidance Computer (Computer History Museum). The Apollo Guidance Computer only had Four Kilobytes, which is about 4000 Bytes of memory (Computer History Museum). To compare the average Smart Phone in 2025 has about Eight Gigabytes, which is about 8 billion Bytes (Computer History Museum).</p>

   <p>Computers were then made to be cheaper so that everyone could afford to purchase one (Computer History Museum). Smart Phone were introduced in the 2000s which had changed how we think of computers (Computer History Museum). Now days it is almost impossible to life without having to use some sort of computer system (Computer History Museum).</p>
