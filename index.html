   <h1>The Future of Technology and Humanity</h1>

   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <hr>
   <p>Have you ever wondered what technology will be like within the next century? What will be so unique about it, and how will it make human life more convenient? How will the human race behave and adapt with this constant change and implantation of technology? This article will explain my reasons and showcase my ideas and theories into the near future with technology and humanity.</p>
   <hr>
   <h2>The History of Computers</h2>
   <hr>
   <p>First before we look into the future, let us look into the past. Thought out the last one hundred years computers have had a long and complex history. Computers were first starting to be really studied and designed around the Second World War (Computer History Museum). Many complex prototypes were created by both the Axis and the Allie forces (Computer History Museum). In 1948 the first ever Program was run on a computer which was groundbreaking (Computer History Museum). This first program was a calculator, which was ran on a computer about the size of a classroom (Computer History Museum). </p>
   <p>Computer were then made to be faster, smaller, and more efficient thought out the 50s and 60s (Computer History Museum). Keyboard inputs were made to be more direct and user-friendly and was also made to replace punched cards and paper tape (Computer History Museum). With the help of computers, we were able to put a man on the moon with the Apollo Guidance Computer (Computer History Museum). The Apollo Guidance Computer only had Four Kilobytes, which is about 4000 Bytes of memory (Computer History Museum). To compare the average Smart Phone in 2025 has about Eight Gigabytes, which is about 8 billion Bytes (Computer History Museum).</p>

   <p>Computers were then made to be cheaper so that everyone could afford to purchase one (Computer History Museum). Smart Phone were introduced in the 2000s which had changed how we think of computers (Computer History Museum). Now days it is almost impossible to life without having to use some sort of computer system (Computer History Museum).</p>

   <h2>The Benefits and Negatives of Computers</h2>
   <hr>
   <p>Now days computers are everywhere. They can be found in stores, restaurants with kiosks, and even in our phones. However like everything else in our world, computers come with their pros and their cons. </p>
   <p>Computers have greatly improved the way we communicate (University of Arkansas Grantham). We can be from on side of the world and see others face in real time from another side of the world (University of Arkansas Grantham). This was great efficient during the Covid-19 Pandemic in which we were able to have communications with friends and family. Computers have increased Efficiency and Productivity with the workplace (University of Arkansas Grantham). Tools like Microsoft Office and Spelling check software have made office work easier and efficient then ever before (University of Arkansas Grantham). Computers also allow the access of countless amounts of Data and Information (University of Arkansas Grantham). With computers you can accuses many different websites, archives, libraries, and much more (University of Arkansas Grantham). This is all available thought the use of your smartphone (University of Arkansas Grantham).</p>
   <p>Even with these great benefits, computer have just as bad of a downside. Computer decrease activity levels (University of Arkansas Grantham). Overuse of computer can make you unfit or cause many health problems (University of Arkansas Grantham). This is because of the fact that you are mostly looking at a screen while siting on hours on end (University of Arkansas Grantham). Overuse of computers can decrease your Mental Health (University of Arkansas Grantham). This is even more true if your physical health is also unfit, because your physical health can influence your mental health (University of Arkansas Grantham). Social Isolation can also occur if the overuse of computers (University of Arkansas Grantham). Cyberbullying and other spending a lot of time with a computer screen can be negatively impacting to your social well being (University of Arkansas Grantham). Although most of these issues are caused by overusing computers too much, it can be very easy to get addicted to using computers (University of Arkansas Grantham).</p>
   <hr>
   <p>Since we have seen the History, Benefits and Negatives of Computers, let us see how they can change and impact the future of Humanity. For the next two parts of this article, I will show my research findings first. Then I will share what I think will happen with Computers and the Future of Humanity with their use.</p>
